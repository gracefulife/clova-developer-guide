<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note!</strong></p>
  <p>Any guidelines or specifications not mentioned in this document can be implemented according to the manufacturer's needs or policies. However, if you are uncertain and need help to decide, contact the partnership team.</p>
</div>

## Client states and events {#ClientStateAndEvent}

You should design and implement the client devices for easy user recognition and operation, such as for user voice inputs, Clova voice outputs, microphone states, or error occurrences (e.g. an error in the Clova service or network). For this, you need to understand the states of the client device, and the actions and flow between states. The following diagram shows the client state cycle.

![](/Design/Resources/Images/Clova-Client-State_Diagram.png)

The description on the client states are as follows:

| State                | Description                                                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Attending              | A state where the client is waiting for user's voice input.                        |
| Error                  | A state where a system error has occurred.                                                |
| Hearing                | A state where the client is receiving user's voice input.                            |
| Idle                   | A state where client is not performing any tasks.                             |
| Mute on                | A state where microphone is set to mute.                                               |
| Processing & reporting | A state where Clova is processing the user's voice request or Clova's voice is being output through the speakers. |

The above states can be expressed using [Lights](#Light), [Sound effects](#SoundEffect), or [Screens](#Screen). And the transition between states can be initiated or executed by the user's voice, [Buttons](#Button) controls, or other environmental factors.

The following events can occur in the client and it must also be expressed using sounds or lights.

| Event               | Description                                                           |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alarm             | Sounds at a specified date and time.                                           |
| Reminder       | Displays or reads out content input by the user at a specified date and time.         |
| Timer            | Sounds after a specified time has elapsed.                                        |

## Buttons {#Button}

A client device must provide buttons to allow the user to control the device directly instead of speaking. This section describes the buttons that can be provided by the client and the guidelines for implementation.

### Button guidelines {#ButtonGuideline}

The following guidelines must be followed when providing buttons.

* The power and the mic mute buttons are recommended to be provided as physical buttons.
* Buttons other than the power and the mic mute buttons can be provided in various forms according to the manufacturer's policy, such as a physical or touch UI buttons.
* The most commonly used buttons are recommended to be placed on the front or the top of the client device for easy operation.
* If you are providing a touch UI button, make sure that the defined action is executed upon the touch release gesture.
* If there are no predefined combinations of buttons, only the function of the first recognized button must be executed at a simultaneous input of multiple buttons.
* If there is new button input while a task is already in progress from a previous input, the feedback effect on the previous input must be stopped to provide the feedback effect on the latest input.
* It is permitted to provide the play and pause button as GUIs for devices supporting UI screens.
* The buttons may be provided via the following methods:
  - An exclusive button for one type of function only (e.g. a button for Bluetooth)
  - Using the long-press gesture on the button to provide a function (e.g. reset via the long press gesture of the power button)
  - Using a combination of buttons to provide a function (e.g. reset by pressing the power and play button simultaneously)

## LED {#Light}

A client device must provide lights to indicate the [Client states and events](#ClientStateAndEvent) or the feedback on user request. This section describes the lights that can be provided by the client and the guidelines for implementation.

* [Light colors](#LightColor)
* [Light effects](#LightEffect)
* [Light guidelines](#LightGuideline)

### Light colors {#LightColor}

The client must use the following colors of light:

| Light color     | RGB value                | Description                                   | Required |

### Light effects {#LightEffect}

Light effects are used for the purpose of delivering a more detailed on the meaning or state on top of the meaning delivered by the [Light colors](#LightColor).

The table below shows the light effects that must be expressed when implemented on a client device along with its descriptions and examples.

| Light effect                            | Description                                      | Example                                                               |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Start alarm, reminder, or timer      | Repeat the rippling effect of the Warm White light.  | Optional     |

### Light guidelines {#LightGuideline}

The following guidelines must be followed when providing lights.
  - A person with eyesight of 0.7 (decimal visual acuity) must be able to distinguish the [Light colors](#LightColor) within 1 meter distance.
  - For light colors, avoid applying states or meanings other than the predefined.
  - The light colors must be applied so that the user can perceive the graphic RGB color and the actual light color as the same.
  - In addition to the essential [Light effects](#LightEffect), you can add other light colors or effects depending on your UX policies or for appropriate situations, such as bootup, speaker volume controls, charging status, and button feedback.
  - It is recommended that you do not express too many meanings or states with a single light color or effect.
  - For screenless devices, it is recommended to indicate the level of the speaker volume by methods, such as brightness of lights.
  - For battery powered portable devices, it is recommended to implement the light effect so the information on the charging status can be gained from the light.

## Sound {#Audio}

This section describes the guidelines for outputting audio content or sound effects from the client device.

* [Rules for basic audio playback](#AudioInterruptionRule)
* [Audio playback rules for user utterance](#AudioInterruptionRuleForUserUtterance)
* [Sound effects](#SoundEffect)
* [Supported audio compression formats](#SupportedAudioCompressionFormat)

### Rules for basic audio playback {#AudioInterruptionRule}

A client may have to play other audio content during audio playback. In this case, the client must play audio content according to the rules for audio playback. The rules for audio playback were written based on the types of audio content. Thus, an understanding of the types of audio content is required before understanding the audio playback rules. The types of audio content are as follows:

| Audio content type | Description                                                                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alert         | Audio content, such as notification sounds, reminder utterance, alarm sounds, timer sounds, and emergency warning sounds.                   |
| Content       | Audio content, such as music, stories, news, and podcasts provided upon user request.                            |
| Dialogue      | TTS audio content provided on the user request.                                                  |
| Notification  | Beep sound, alarm speech, message push, and system notification (e.g. notification for low battery or Bluetooth disconnection).         |

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note!</strong></p>
  <p>Alert and notification types recognize the alarm sounds, beep sounds, and utterance as a single audio content. For example, the reminder recognizes the notification sound and reminder utterance as a single alert audio content. For a low battery notification, the "Not enough battery." notification and the beep sound becomes a single notification audio content.</p>
</div>

The rules for audio playback are as follows:

* For physical buttons, the sound effects must be played instantly being output in the mixing method.
* Audio contents must be played instantly. If an audio content is playing, it must be processed as background audio to play the new audio.
* However, if the [Content type](#AudioInterruptionRule) of the audio playing and the new audio is the same, follow the process below.
  - For **Alert, Dialogue, Content type**: cancel the audio content playing and play the new audio content.
  - For **Notification type**: continue playing the audio content and keep the new audio content in the playback queue. After finishing the current audio content, play the following audio content in the queue order.

Based on above rules, the following table shows how to process the playing audio content for each audio content type:

<table style="text-align:center">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan="2">Type of playing content</th>
      <th colspan="4">Type of content to play</th>
      <th rowspan="2">Sound effect of physical button</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Alert</th>
      <th>Content</th>
      <th>Dialogue</th>
      <th>Notification</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Alert</th>
      <td>Cancel play</td>
      <td>Process as background audio</td>
      <td>Process as background audio</td>
      <td>Process as background audio</td>
      <td rowspan="4">Process mixing</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Content</th>
      <td>Process as background audio</td>
      <td>Cancel play</td>
      <td>Process as background audio</td>
      <td>Process as background audio</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Dialogue</th>
      <td>Process as background audio</td>
      <td>Process as background audio</td>
      <td>Cancel play</td>
      <td>Process as background audio</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Notification</th>
      <td>Process as background audio</td>
      <td>Process as background audio</td>
      <td>Process as background audio</td>
      <td>Continue playing (queue)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Audio playback rules for user utterance {#AudioInterruptionRuleForUserUtterance}

If a user attempts voice input while the client is playing audio content, follow the rules below:

* If there is an audio content being played, process it as a background audio from the attending state to the processing & reporting state.
* If the waiting time for voice input has been exceeded or the user request processing has failed, the audio content processed as the background audio must be played in the original mode.
* In case of having to play other audio content depending on the processed result of the request, audio contents must be played in accordance with the [Rules for basic audio playback](#AudioInterruptionRule).
* The same rules apply for the hearing and processing & reporting states gained from attempting multi-turn conversations.

If there is a request to play a new audio content during the attending and hearing state, process the request as follows:

* For playing audio content of **alert/dialogue/content** type, the audio content must be played after canceling the receipt of user's voice input.
* For playing audio content of **notification** type, the notification audio content must be played as the background audio.

### Sound effects {#SoundEffect}

A client must provide sound effects in addition to the [Lights](#Light) in order to convey the device status or feedback on a user's request. This section explains the types of sound effects to be provided by the client to the user and the situations for providing it.

* [Types of sound effects](#SoundEffects)
* [Sound effect guidelines](#SoundEffectGuideline)

#### Sound effect type {#SoundEffects}

In order to express [states and events](#ClientStateAndEvent) of the client, the following sound effects must be provided:

| Disabling the mute on state           | <audio title="Mute off" controls><source src="./Resources/Sounds/Clova-Client-SoundEffect-Mute_Off.wav" type="audio/wav" /></audio>   | Required     |
| Alarm/reminder (When an event occurs, repeat the sound effect.) | <audio title="Alarm" controls><source src="./Resources/Sounds/Clova-Client-SoundEffect-Alarm.wav" type="audio/wav" /></audio>         | Required     |
| Timer (When an event occurs, repeat the sound effect.)      | <audio title="Timer" controls><source src="./Resources/Sounds/Clova-Client-SoundEffect-Timer.wav" type="audio/wav" /></audio>         | Required     |

#### Sound effect guidelines {#SoundEffectGuideline}

The following guidelines must be followed when providing sound effects.

* It is recommended that the provided sound effects are used without any alteration.
* Other sound effects may be added depending on your UX policies or for appropriate situations.
* Users must be able to recognize each situation by the sound.
* The sound effects must be consistent with the light effects or screen states.
* If you are providing a sound effect for button feedback, it must be suitable to the property and feeling of a button.

### Supported audio compression formats {#SupportedAudioCompressionFormat}
