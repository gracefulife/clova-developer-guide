# Clova developer console overview

Clova developer console is a web tool providing required information or functions when developing devices or services that connect with the Clova platform. A client developer enters the information of the client to develop through the Clova developer console and sets up the security information for the corresponding client to [access CIC](/CIC/CIC_Overview.md). An extension developer [enters the extension information](/DevConsole/Guides/CEK/Register_Extension.md) and [registers an interaction model](/DevConsole/Guides/CEK/Register_Interaction_Model.md) to allow exchange of messages between the CEK and extension. Also, an extension developer must test the extension and request an extension review for [extension deployment](/DevConsole/Guides/CEK/Deploy_Extension.md).

When developing clients or extensions, the Clova developer console is used in the following structure:
