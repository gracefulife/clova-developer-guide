# Clova Developer Console Overview

Clova developer console is a web tool providing necessary features or functions to develop devices or service integrating to Clova platform.  A client developer should enter information of a client (device or app) which is about to be developed through the Clova developer console. Also should set security information so that the client can [access to CIC](/CIC/CIC_Overview.md). An extension developer should [enter extension information](/DevConsole/Guides/CEK/Register_Extension.md) and [register an interaction model](/DevConsole/Guides/CEK/Define_Interaction_Model.md) to allow CEK and extension to exchange messages.  Furthermore, the extension developer should test an extension and request for a review to [distribute the extension](/DevConsole/Guides/CEK/Deploy_Extension.md).

The Clova developer console will work in a structure as below when developing clients or extensions.
