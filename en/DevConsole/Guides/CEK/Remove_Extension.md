# Canceling and deleting an extension

You can delete an extension, in the status prior to the review request, on the page to [enter the basic extension information](/DevConsole/Guides/CEK/Register_Extension.md#InputExtensionInfo).

However, you cannot delete the extensions in the following statuses:

* Extension under review
* Extension in service

If the extension is under review, you can delete it any time after canceling the review request.

If the extension is in service after passing the review, you can delete it after canceling the service. If you cancel the service, the status of the extension is changed to a **{{ book.DevConsole.cek_status_dev }}** status.
