# Disabling and deleting an extension

You can delete an extension on the page where you [enter the basic extension information](/DevConsole/Guides/CEK/Register_Extension.md#InputExtensionInfo) if you have not yet requested a review for the extension.

However, you cannot delete extensions in the following situations:

* Extension is under review
* Extension is in service

If the extension is under review, you can delete it any time after canceling the review request.

If the extension is in service after passing the review, you can delete it after disabling the service. If you disable the service, the status of the extension is changed to **{{ book.DevConsole.cek_status_dev }}**.

  <p>A check from the Clova operations team is required to disable a service. To stop the service of an extension, contact the operations team via <a href="mailto://{{ book.ExtensionAdminEmail }}">{{ book.ExtensionAdminEmail }}</a>.</p>
