## Using CEK menu
The CEK menu of Clova developer console is used to register and release extensions. An interaction model has to be defined through the CEK menu for [CEK](/CEK/CEK_Overview.md#WhatisCEK) to acquire server synchronization details to exchange information between Clova and extensions and to analyze correct intentions of user requests.

The CEK menu page will appear upon clicking a menu on the left side or a bar menu at the center.
