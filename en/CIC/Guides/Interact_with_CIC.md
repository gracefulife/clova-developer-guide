# Interacting with CIC
To provide Clova services for users, you must make your client (app or device) use the CIC interface to send user requests and contextual information to Clova. First, you need to understand how to connect your client with CIC, which messages are sent and received, and which actions are performed during the process.

This documentation covers the following topics to provide essential information for client development.
