## Connecting with CIC {#ConnectToCIC}
To connect your client with CIC, complete the following steps.
* [Creating Clova access token](#CreateClovaAccessToken)
* [Creating connection](#CreateConnection)
* [Getting authorization](#Authorization)
* [Managing connection](#ManageConnection)

### Creating Clova access token {#CreateClovaAccessToken}
To use Clova, users must authenticate their {{ book.TargetServiceForClientAuth }} account on your client (device or app). And, to attempt to connect your client with CIC, you must obtain a Clova access token, which has been authorized with its {{ book.TargetServiceForClientAuth }} account credentials. You use [Clova Auth API](/CIC/References/Clova_Auth_API.md) for this process.

Below image displays the flow of how a client is obtaining the Clova access token.  The client is distinguished into two types and according to each type, the process of acquiring the Clova access token can vary.
* Device type client: A Clova service supported client which is embedded in speakers or home appliances.  The device type client provides an exclusive paired app to aid users since they can experience inconvenience with account authentication from such type.
* App type client: A Clova service supported client which is in software just like the Clova app.

Below are the steps to obtain a Clova access token.

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In your client app or app paired with a client device, add an interface for users to authenticate their {{ book.TargetServiceForClientAuth }} account (<a href="{{ book.LoginAPIofTargetService }}" target="_blank">{{ book.TargetServiceForClientAuth }} Login SDK</a>). You must use client app or paired app because user's speech input alone cannot handle account authentication.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obtain an access token for the {{ book.TargetServiceForClientAuth }} account, using the {{ book.TargetServiceForClientAuth }} account information entered by the user.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/CIC/References/Clova_Auth_API.html#RequestAuthorizationCode">Request an authorization code</a> by providing the {{ book.TargetServiceForClientAuth }} account access token and <a href="#ClientAuthInfo">client credentials</a>. Use client's MAC address with <code>device_id</code> field value or by generating UUID hash value. Below is an example of requesting an authorization code.</p>
    <pre><code>$ curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer QHSDAKLFJASlk12jlkf+asldkjasdf=sldkjf123dsalsdflkvpasdFMrjvi23scjaf123klv'
    {{ book.AuthServerBaseURL }}authorize \
    --data-urlencode 'client_id=c2Rmc2Rmc2FkZ2Fasdkjh234zZnNhZGZ' \
    --data-urlencode 'device_id=aa123123d6-d900-48a1-b73b-aa6c156353206' \
    --data-urlencode 'model_id=test_model' \
    --data-urlencode 'response_type=code' \
    --data-urlencode 'state=FKjaJfMlakjdfTVbES5ccZ'
</code></pre>
    <p>The following is the body of the received response message. <code>code</code> field is the authorization code.</p>
    <pre><code>{
  "code": "cnl__eCSTdsdlkjfweyuxXvnlA",
  "state": "FKjaJfMlakjdfTVbES5ccZ"
}
</code></pre></li>
  <li>
    <p>(If received <code>451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons</code> status code as a response to <a href="/CIC/References/Clova_Auth_API.html#RequestAuthorizationCode">authorization code request</a>) Find the URI recorded on <code>rediriec_uri</code> field from the message body and show terms and conditions agreement page to the user. Below is an example of a response message which will be received when the status code is <code>451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons</code>.</p>
    <pre><code>{
  "code": "4mrklvwoC_KNgDlvmslka",
  "redirect_uri": "https://ssl.pstatic.net/static/clova/service/terms/place/terms_3rd.html?code=4mrklvwoC_KNgDlvmslka&grant_type=code&state=FKjaJfMlakjdfTVbES5ccZ",
  "state": "FKjaJfMlakjdfTVbES5ccZ"
}
</code></pre>
    <p>If the user does not agree to the terms and conditions, the next step cannot be processed. Once the user agrees to the terms and conditions and the result of agreement is sent to the server, your client will receive a response containing <code>302 Found</code>(URL Redirection) status code along with the following URL.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>clova://agreement-success</code> : The user successfully agreed to the terms and conditions. The client can continue to the next process to create the Clova access token.</li>
      <li><code>clova://agreement-failure</code> : The user failed to agree to the terms and conditions due to a server error. The client should exclude the failure properly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(If it is a paired app) Forward the authorization code to the client device.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pass the authorization code and <a href="#ClientAuthInfo">client credentials</a> as parameters and <a href="/CIC/References/Clova_Auth_API.html#RequestClovaAccessToken">request a Clova access token</a>. Below is an example of requesting a Clova access token.</p>
    <pre><code>$ curl {{ book.AuthServerBaseURL }}token?grant_type=authorization_code \
    --data-urlencode 'client_id=c2Rmc2Rmc2FkZ2Fasdkjh234zZnNhZGZ' \
    --data-urlencode 'client_secret=66qo65asdfasdfaA7JasdfasfOqwnOq1rOyfgeydtCDrvYasfasf%3D' \
    --data-urlencode 'code=cnl__eCSTdsdlkjfweyuxXvnlA' \

    --data-urlencode 'model_id=test_model'
</code></pre>
    <p>The Clova access token is returned as follows.</p>
    <pre><code>{
    "access_token": "XHapQasdfsdfFsdfasdflQQ7w",
    "expires_in": 332000,

  </li>
</ol>

### Creating CIC connection {#CreateConnection}
To establish an initial connection between your client and CIC, the first thing to do is [creating a downchannel](/CIC/References/CIC_API.md#EstablishDownchannel). A downchannel is used when you receive directive messages from CIC. These directive messages are not responses prompted by event messages. They are messages initiated exclusively by CIC (cloud-initiated) when certain conditions are met or when any needs arise. For example, when a new alarm (push) arrives, a directive message will be sent through a downchannel.

To create a downchannel, send a `GET` request to `/v1/directives`. Once a downchannel is established, CIC keeps the connection open.

{% raw %}

```
:method: GET
:scheme: https
:path = /v1/directives
Authorization: Bearer {{ClovaAccessToken}}
```

{% endraw %}

When the connection request is processed successfully, CIC returns a [`Clova.Hello`](/CIC/References/CICInterface/Clova.md#Hello) directive message as a response. It indicates that CIC is ready to send more directive messages through the downchannel.

{% raw %}

```
{
    "directive": {
        "header": {
            "messageId": "2ca2ec70-c39d-4741-8a34-8aedd3b24760",
            "namespace": "Clova",
            "name": "Hello"
        },
        "payload": {}
    }
}
```

{% endraw %}

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note!</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Once a client app or device has started, it must always maintain one active downchannel with CIC. If any new request is sent to <code>/v1/directives</code> when an active downchannel already exists, that existing downchannel will be closed.</li>
    <li>See <a href="#Authorization">Getting authorization</a> for more details on filling in the Authorization header field.</li>
  </ul>
</div>


### Getting authorization {#Authorization}
When sending requests to CIC, you must send [Clova access tokens](#CreateClovaAccessToken) along with the requests. Enter Clova access token's type and value, separated by a space, in the Authorization header field as follows. See [CIC API reference](/CIC/References/CIC_API.md) for more details.

{% raw %}

```
:method: {{GET|POST}}
:scheme: https
:path = {{/v1/events|/v1/directives}}
Authorization: Bearer {{ClovaAccessToken}}
```

{% endraw %}

Every time you send a new request (event message), you must send a Clova access token together as shown in the picture below.

![](/CIC/Resources/Images/CIC_Message_Interaction_Diagram.png)

### Managing connection {#ManageConnection}

Once a connection is established between your client and CIC, manage the connection by running the following tasks.

* [Maintaining downchannel](#KeepDownchannel)
* [Performing ping-pong](#DoPingpong)
* [Refreshing access token](#RefreshAccessToken)

#### Maintaining downchannel {#KeepDownchannel}
When an existing downchannel is closed or disconnected, [create a new downchannel](#CreateConnection) immediately to prevent from failing to receive directive messages from CIC.

#### Performing ping-pong {#DoPingpong}

Send HTTP/2 PING frames to CIC in every 1 minute to confirm connectivity with CIC. When failing to receive HTTP/2 PING ACK responses from CIC, establish a new connection immediately to maintain a connection between your client and CIC. Refer to [HTTP/2 PING Payload Format](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#rfc.figure.12) for more details on the HTTP/2 PING frame.

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note!</strong></p>
  <p>If your client cannot send HTTP/2 PING frames, it must send <code>GET</code> requests to <code>/ping</code> every 1 minute, at which points, it will receive an HTTP 204 No Content response. As is the case with HTTP/2 PING frames, if it fails to receive responses, establish a new connection immediately.</p>
  <p>This is an example of sending a <code>GET</code> request to <code>/ping</code>.</p>
  <pre><code>:method = GET
:scheme = https
:path = /ping
Authorization = Bearer {{YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN}}
</code></pre>
</div>

#### Refreshing access token {#RefreshAccessToken}

When obtaining an access token, you can check its expiry time from the `expires_in` field. If the time expires, or if you receive an [error message](/CIC/References/CIC_API.md#Error) that reads, "HTTP 401 Unauthorized", you must refresh the access token. [To refresh the Clova access token](/CIC/References/Clova_Auth_API.md#RefreshClovaAccessToken), send the refresh token (`refresh_token`) you have received when [obtaining the Clova access token](/CIC/References/Clova_Auth_API.md#RequestClovaAccessToken) and pass required parameters, as shown below.

<pre><code>$ curl {{ book.AuthServerBaseURL }}token?grant_type=refresh_token \
       --data-urlencode 'client_id=c2Rmc2Rmc2FkZ2FzZnNhZGZ' \
       --data-urlencode 'client_secret=66qo65asdfasdfaA7JasdfasfOqwnOq1rOyfgeydtCDrvYasfasf%3D' \
       --data-urlencode 'refresh_token=GW-Ipsdfasdfdfs3IbHFBA' \
       --data-urlencode 'device_id=aa123123d6-d900-48a1-b73b-aa6c156353206' \
       --data-urlencode 'model_id=test_model'
</code></pre>
