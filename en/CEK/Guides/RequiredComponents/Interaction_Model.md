* **Interaction model**

  An interaction model for your custom extension. You must register the interaction model on the Clova developer console. The interaction model can be seen as a dialogue scenario between users and Clova that contains the definitions for sentences that users may ask Clova, and the intent and information behind each sentence.

  For more information on defining the interaction model, see [Defining an interaction model](/Design/Design_Guideline_For_Extension.md#DefineInteractionModel).
