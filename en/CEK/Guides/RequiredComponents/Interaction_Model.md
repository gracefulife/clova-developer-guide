* **Interaction Model**

This is an interaction model of the custom extension that will be registered in the Clova developer console. The interaction model can be seen as a dialog scenario between a user and Clova. It defines the sentences that users may ask and sets the intent and information of each sentence.

For more information on defining the interaction mode, see [Defining an interaction model](/Design/Design_Guideline_For_Extension.md#DefineInteractionModel).
