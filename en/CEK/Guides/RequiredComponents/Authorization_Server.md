* **Authorization Server**

  The user account must be linked if the custom extension is providing 3rd party services that require user account authentication, such as music, shopping, and banking services. An authorization server must be built for account linking. For more information, see [Linking user account](/CEK/Guides/Link_User_Account.md).
