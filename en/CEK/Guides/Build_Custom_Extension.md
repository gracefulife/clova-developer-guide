# Building custom extension

A custom extension lets you provide your own extended capabilities and 3rd party services, instead of the standard features and services of Clova. For example, you can build a custom extension that provides web searching service or news clipping service. You can also build a custom extension for a 3rd party service that requires user authentication such as music, shopping or banking. When CEK sends analysis details of user's speech input to your custom extension, your custom extension takes an appropriate action and returns processing results. The following explains what preparations are required before you start building your custom extension, and which messages your extension exchanges with CEK and how it performs necessary actions during the process.
