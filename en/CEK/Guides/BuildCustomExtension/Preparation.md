## Preparation {#Preparation}
To develop a custom extension, prepare the following.

| Item         | Description                            |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Interaction Model | When you develop a custom extension, the first thing to do is defining an interaction model on how your extension will receive requests from users. An interaction model provides a standardized schema for each type of request that your custom extension will be receiving. It should be pre-registered through [Clova Developer Console](/DevConsole/ClovaDevConsole_Overview.md). |
| (Optional) Authentification Server | If your custom extension provides a 3rd party service that requires users to authenticate their account, such as music, shopping or banking, the account linking is necessary. To do so, you must set up an authorization server. See [Linking user account](/CEK/Guides/Link_User_Account.md) for more details. |
