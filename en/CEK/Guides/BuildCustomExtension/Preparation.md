## Preparation {#Preparation}
To develop a custom extension, prepare the following.

* [Interaction model](#InteractionModel)
* (Optional) [Authorization server](#AuthServer)

### Interaction model {#InteractionModel}
When you develop a custom extension, the first thing to do is defining an interaction model on how your extension will receive requests from users. An interaction model provides a standardized schema for each type of request that your custom extension will be receiving. Once the interaction model is defined, register following information in the Clova Developer Console.

| Item         | Description                            |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| `Intent`              | A specification that defines different types of user requests. Your custom extension must have its own interaction model consisting of a set of `intent`. CEK sends details of user's speech input to your extension, using an [`IntentRequest`](/CEK/References/CEK_API.md#CustomExtIntentRequest) message. The message is constructed based on `intent` defined in the interaction model. |
| `slot` | Slots are information necessary for processing a request declared in `intent`. You must define slots when defining an `intent`. Clova analyzes a user request and extracts information specific to slots. When CEK sends an `IntentRequest` message to your extension, the `slot` information is also sent in key-value pairs.  |
| Examples of user speech        | List of examples showing how a user's spoken request can be put in. You can define multiple example sentences for each `Intent`. Example sentences are denoted with `slot`. Clova uses this information when it analyzes user requests. |

Assume your custom extension provides a pizza ordering service and it has received a request from a user saying, "I'd like to order two pepperoni pizzas". The user request can be defined into an intent as follows.

![](/CEK/Resources/Images/CEK_Interaction_Model_Analysis_Diagram.png)

This is an interaction model defined in JSON format.

{% raw %}

```json

{
  "intents": [
    {
      "intent": "OrderPizza",
      "slots": [
        {
          "name": "PizzaAmount",
          "type": "CLOVA.NUMBER"
        },
        {
          "name": "PizzaType",
          "type": "CUSTOM.PIZZA_TYPE"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "intent": "OrderSideDish",
      ...
    }
    ...
  ]
}

```

{% endraw %}

The example shows how a user's request is mapped to pre-defined `intent` and `slot`. You can use this information to process other user requests that have the same intention but are expressed in different ways.

{% raw %}

```

OrerPizza {CUSTOM.PIZZA_TYPE} 주문해줘
OrderItem {CUSTOM.PIZZA_TYPE} 주문해줄래?
OrderItem {CUSTOM.PIZZA_TYPE} {CLOVA.NUMBER}판 주문해줘
...
OrderSIdeDish {CUSTOM.SIDE_DISH} 주문해줘

```

{% endraw %}

Your custom extension receives a message as below based on the pre-defined interaction model.

{% raw %}

```json

{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "session": {
    "new": false,
    "sessionAttributes": {},
    "sessionId": "a29cfead-c5ba-474d-8745-6c1a6625f0c5",
    "user": {
      "userId": "V0qe",
      "accessToken": "XHapQasdfsdfFsdfasdflQQ7"
    }
  },
  "context": {
    "System": {
      "user": {
        "userId": "V0qe",
        "accessToken": "XHapQasdfsdfFsdfasdflQQ7"
      },
      "device": {
        "deviceId": "096e6b27-1717-33e9-b0a7-510a48658a9b"
      }
    }
  },
  "request": {
    "type": "IntentRequest",
    "intent": {
      "name": "OrderPizza",
      "slots": {
        "PizzaAmount": {
          "name": "PizzaAmount",
          "value": "2"
        },
        "PizzaType": {
          "name": "PizzaType",
          "value": "페퍼로니"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

{% endraw %}

### Authorization server {#AuthServer}
If your custom extension provides a 3rd party service that requires users to authenticate their account, such as music, shopping or banking, account linking is necessary. To do so, you must set up an authorization server. See [Linking user account](/CEK/Guides/LinkUserAccount.md) for more details.
