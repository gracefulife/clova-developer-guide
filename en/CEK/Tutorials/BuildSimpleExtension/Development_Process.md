The overall process of creating an extension is as follows:
* Step 1. Preparing an extension server (individually)
* Step 2. Registering basic extension information (on the Clova developer console)
* Step 3. Registering an interaction model (on the Clova developer console)
* Step 4. Testing the extension (on the Clova developer console and real device)
