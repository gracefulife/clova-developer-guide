# Tutorial
To link your service with Clova, you must develop an extension. This tutorial uses the [Dice Drawer](/CEK/Examples/Extension_Examples.md#DiceDrawer) example to conduct the basic developing phase of the extension, and helps developers become familiar with developing for Clova.

The purpose of the Dice Drawer extension is in its name (to roll a dice and show the result).
However, for this tutorial, we will create an extension with the name “Sample Dice” to avoid any confusion with “Dice Drawer,” which is currently in service.
